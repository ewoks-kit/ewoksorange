Starting a new project from scratch
===================================

`Orange <https://orangedatamining.com/>`_ widgets can be written and associated to the Ewoks tasks provided by an Ewoks project.

For this, the Ewoks project needs to be setup as an *Orange Add-on* project. To bootstrap your project you can use either:


* `The ewoks cookie cutter project <https://gitlab.esrf.fr/workflow/ewoksapps/ewokscookie>`_
* `The template project <https://gitlab.esrf.fr/workflow/ewoksapps/ewoksorangetemplate/>`_ with the `associated documentation<https://ewoksorangetemplate.readthedocs.io/>`_.
