Writing Orange Widgets
------------------------

Getting started
===============

`Orange <https://orangedatamining.com/>`_ widgets can be written and associated to the Ewoks tasks provided by an Ewoks project.

For this, the Ewoks project needs to be setup as an *Orange Add-on* project. 
A template project can be found `here <https://gitlab.esrf.fr/workflow/ewoksapps/ewoksorangetemplate/>`_.

Further documentation can be found `here <https://ewoksorangetemplate.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Note on designs
